Critique
========
Vision Statement
----------------
* There should be a large focus on the customer and order tracking, not just the routing.
* Seems to use a lot to say very little; not very clear what the goal for the supplier is.

Information on Target Customers and Their Needs
-----------------------------------------------
* Not so much schedule conflicts as it is routing conflicts. Don't need salespeople overlapping routes.

Critical Success Factors
------------------------
**Scalability**

* Unnecessary. We only need this system to work in Calgary.

**Ease of Use**

* Ok

**Security**

* Some extrapolation in this area would be nice.
* The manager should be able to see **all** information in the system, for every employee.
* What "sensitive information" is being hidden from other users? Salesmen should only be able to see their own information.

**Performance**

* Recursive calls? Customers (us) probably don't understand that or why it would make the system slower.
* What if we want to add a customer in the morning and have a salesman go there in the afternoon?

Tentative Release Plan
----------------------
**Priorities**

* Minimalism is nice, but the system must be functional first and foremost.

**Iteration 1**

* What if additional functionality is requested later in development? The GUI will need the change again.
* Drop down list of customers could become unwieldy with many customers. Perhaps some sort of searching functionality?
* Salesmen should have access to the "placing an order" form. Should be combined with the salesman form (the "completion of sale" one).
* Why assign orders to salespeople? Orders will likely be going out via delivery company. (confusing)
* Total profit seems like something that could be automatically calculated
* Want to be able to add description and company name to customer
* Salesmen should see their route on signing in, not orders. Salesmen's primary role is sales, not order fulfilling.
* Seems like there might be a bit of confusion on the sales/orders idea.
* Will the system be usable in this state or just a GUI with no functionality? Seems like it says it is only a GUI but it will be showing data as well?

**Iteration 2**

* Ok

**Iteration 3**

* Take into account traffic in routing optimization?

Operational Requirements
------------------------
* Did not request to have application run on smartphones.
* What system will be required to run this? What if we have Macs and Linux machines we want to run the application on?
